# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game lets the user pick a maximum number, and then try to guess a randomly generated number within that range. It gives instant feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Everything runs in the browser â€” no console required.

## ðŸ’¡ How it works

- First, you enter the maximum number (e.g., 50).
- The game picks a secret number between 1 and that max.
- You try to guess the number by entering a value.
- The app will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
- You can quit anytime or reset and play again.
